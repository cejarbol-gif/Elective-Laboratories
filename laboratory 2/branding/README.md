# Laboratory 2 — Branding

This directory holds branding assets for Laboratory 2.

Structure:
- `logo/` — logo files and source artwork (SVG, AI, etc.)
- `palette/` — color palette files (ASE, JSON, PNG samples)
- `banner/` — banner/header images and templates

Place actual assets in the appropriate subfolders. The `.gitkeep` files are placeholders so the empty directories are tracked in git.
